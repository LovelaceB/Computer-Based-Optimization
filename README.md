# Computer-Based-Optimization
In this course I learned the design of optimization algorithms that are commonly used in machine learning applications. 
The programs were written in both R and Python. The Gradient Descent file is a Python implementation of the gradient descent optimization algorithm.
The Knapsack Python file is a Python implementation of the Knapsack optimization problem. 
The optimization final is a binary genetic algorithm that I wrote from scratch in R, an in depth report can be found in this repo.
